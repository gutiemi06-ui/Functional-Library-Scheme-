# Functional-Library-Scheme-
Recursive set operations and list processing utilities implemented in Scheme, demonstrating functional programming principles.

A collection of recursive functions for set operations and list processing, implemented in Scheme.  
This project demonstrates how functional programming principles can be applied to create reusable utilities.

## Features
- Recursive set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Recursive list processing utilities (map, filter, fold)
- Examples of functional abstraction in Scheme

## Tech Stack
- Language: Scheme (Racket compatible)

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of recursion and immutability.
- Applied functional programming concepts to reusable code components.

## How to Run
Open `functions.scm` in Racket or any Scheme interpreter:
```scheme
(load "functions.scm")
